# Issue and Commit Workflow: Complete Guide

## üìñ Overview

This comprehensive guide describes the complete workflow for managing changes in InfoTech.io projects, from opening an Issue to merging code. It provides detailed, step-by-step instructions with practical examples, diagrams, and templates.

### Why This Process Exists

**The Problem**: Without a structured process, development becomes chaotic:
- Unclear what's being worked on and why
- Difficult to review architectural decisions before implementation
- Hard to track progress and understand project history
- Challenging for maintainers to evaluate contributions

**The Solution**: Documentation-as-Code approach:
- ‚úÖ Every change starts with an Issue
- ‚úÖ Plans are documented and reviewed BEFORE coding
- ‚úÖ Progress is tracked with visual diagrams
- ‚úÖ Complete historical record is maintained

## üéØ Types of Work

### 1. Single Issue (Simple Changes)

**When to use**:
- Bug fixes
- Small features
- Documentation updates
- Minor refactoring

**Characteristics**:
- Work completes in 1-3 days
- Single developer
- Changes confined to one area
- No feature branch needed (commits to main)

**Example**: Issue #14 - Caching system blocks custom content

### 2. Large Issue (Complex Changes)

**When to use**:
- Major features requiring 4+ days
- Significant refactoring
- New components or modules
- Complex bug fixes

**Characteristics**:
- Work requires multiple stages
- May need feature branch
- Requires detailed planning
- Multiple related commits

**Example**: Implementing a new authentication system

### 3. Epic Issue (Multi-component Projects)

**When to use**:
- System-wide changes
- Multi-week projects
- Multiple related features
- Cross-repository work

**Characteristics**:
- Broken into Child Issues
- Each Child Issue is a logical work unit
- Requires epic branch
- Coordinated development

**Example**: Epic #15 - Federated Build System

## üèóÔ∏è Documentation Structure

### Directory Structure Rules

All Issues (single, large, or Epic) MUST have documentation in `docs/proposals/`:

#### Single Issue Structure

```
docs/proposals/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {issue-number}-{issue-title-slug}/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ design.md              # High-level solution
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ progress.md            # Visual progress tracking
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 001-stage-name.md      # Detailed plan for stage 1
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 001-progress.md        # Report for stage 1
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 002-stage-name.md      # Detailed plan for stage 2
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 002-progress.md        # Report for stage 2
```

**Example** (Issue #14):
```
docs/proposals/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 14-caching-system-blocks-custom-content/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ design.md
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ progress.md

    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 002-hypothesis-verification.md
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 002-progress.md
```

#### Epic Issue Structure

```
docs/proposals/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ epic-{number}-{epic-title-slug}/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ design.md                    # Epic-level design
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ progress.md                  # Epic-level progress
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ child-{number}-{child-title-slug}/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ design.md                # Child-level design
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ progress.md              # Child-level progress
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 001-stage-name.md        # Stage 1 plan
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 001-progress.md          # Stage 1 report

        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 002-progress.md          # Stage 2 report

**Workflow**:

1. **Issue Creation** (GitHub)
   ```markdown
   **Title**: Caching system blocks custom content processing
   **Type**: Bug
   **Priority**: Critical

   **Description**: Cache ignores --content parameter...
   **Impact**: Production blocker...
   **Workaround**: Use --no-cache flag
   ```

2. **Design Documentation** (Commit 1)
   ```bash
   docs/proposals/14-caching-system-blocks-custom-content/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ design.md      # Problem analysis, 5 hypotheses ranked
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ progress.md    # Empty dashboard
   ```

3. **Stage 1 Planning** (Commit 2)
   ```bash
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 001-reproduction.md    # Detailed repro steps
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 001-progress.md        # Empty report
   ```

4. **Implementation** (Commit 3)
   ```bash
   scripts/build.sh    # Fix: add $CONTENT to cache key
   ```

5. **Post-commit** (Commit 4)
   ```bash
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 001-progress.md    # Reproduction successful, bug fixed
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ progress.md        # Diagram updated: Stage 1 ‚úÖ
   ```

6. **Repeat** for testing, documentation stages

7. **Close Issue** when all stages complete

### Example 2: Epic with Child Issues (Epic #15)

**Scenario**: Build system needs federation capability

**Workflow**:

1. **Epic Creation** (GitHub #15)
   ```markdown
   **Title**: Federated Build System

   ```

3. **Child Issues Design** (Commit 2)
   ```bash

## üö´ Common Mistakes and Solutions

### Mistake 1: Skipping Design Phase

**‚ùå Wrong**:
```bash
# Jump straight to coding
git checkout -b feature/new-thing
vim src/new-feature.js
git commit -m "add new feature"
```

**‚úÖ Correct**:
```bash
# Create Issue first
# Then design documentation
mkdir docs/proposals/23-new-feature/
# Write design.md, get review
# THEN code
```

### Mistake 2: Vague Commit Messages

**‚ùå Wrong**:
```bash
git commit -m "fix bug"
git commit -m "update"
git commit -m "changes"
```

**‚úÖ Correct**:
```bash
git commit -m "fix(cache): include content parameter in cache key generation

Cache was ignoring --content flag due to missing variable
in config_hash calculation. Now properly invalidates when
content source changes.

Fixes #14"
```

### Mistake 3: Not Updating Progress

**‚ùå Wrong**:
```bash
# Implement 3 stages
git commit -m "feat: implement all stages"
# Never update progress.md
```

**‚úÖ Correct**:
```bash
# Implement stage 1
git commit -m "feat: implement stage 1"
# Update progress
git commit -m "docs: update progress for stage 1"
# Implement stage 2
git commit -m "feat: implement stage 2"
# Update progress
git commit -m "docs: update progress for stage 2"
```

### Mistake 4: Mixing Epic Branches

**‚ùå Wrong**:
```bash
# Create feature branch from main
git checkout main
git checkout -b feature/epic-child
```

**‚úÖ Correct**:
```bash
# Create feature branch from epic branch
git checkout epic/federated-build-system
git checkout -b feature/federated-script
```

## üéì Best Practices

### 1. Write Design Before Code

**Why**: Catch architectural issues early, get feedback before investing time

**How**:
- Create design.md first
- Get maintainer review
- Adjust based on feedback
- Only then start coding

### 2. Small, Focused Commits

**Why**: Easy to review, easy to revert, clear history

**How**:
- One logical change per commit
- Related changes together (code + tests)
- Update docs in separate commit

### 3. Update Progress Regularly

**Why**: Stakeholders see progress, history is preserved

**How**:
- After completing each stage
- Post-commit with progress update
- Update diagrams to reflect current state

### 4. Link Everything

**Why**: Full traceability from issue to code

**How**:
- Commits reference issues: `Fixes #14`
- Progress docs link to commits
- PRs link to issues and epic

### 5. Test Before Committing

**Why**: Don't break the build, maintain quality

**How**:
- Run tests locally
- Fix any failures
- Add tests for new features
- Verify in clean environment
