## 🔄 Contribution Workflow

### Epic Issues + Child Issues + Feature Branches Strategy

For complex, multi-week development tasks, InfoTech.io follows an industry-standard workflow that ensures traceability, systematic progress tracking, and manageable development cycles.

#### When to Use This Workflow
- **Large Features**: Development tasks requiring 4+ days of work
- **System Overhauls**: Fundamental refactoring or architecture changes
- **Multi-Component Changes**: Work spanning multiple repositories or modules
- **Critical Infrastructure**: CI/CD, build systems, deployment pipelines
- **Major Bug Fixes**: Complex issues requiring extensive testing and validation

#### Workflow Structure

##### 1. Epic Issue Creation
Create a comprehensive Epic Issue in the primary repository that serves as the central coordination point:

```markdown
# Epic Issue Template

## Epic: [DESCRIPTIVE_NAME] v[VERSION]

### Overview
**Problem Statement**: Clear description of what problem this epic solves
**Strategic Value**: Why this work is important for the project
**Success Criteria**: Measurable outcomes that define completion

### Technical Scope
**Architecture Impact**: Components and systems affected
**Breaking Changes**: Any backward compatibility concerns
**Dependencies**: External or internal dependencies
**Risk Assessment**: Potential challenges and mitigation strategies

### Implementation Strategy
**Epic Branch**: `epic/[descriptive-name]-v[version]`
**Estimated Timeline**: X weeks (with buffer)
**Resource Requirements**: Team members, external dependencies
**Quality Gates**: Testing, review, and validation requirements

### Child Issues Breakdown
- [ ] #XXX: [Component 1]: Specific technical task
- [ ] #XXX: [Component 2]: Specific technical task
- [ ] #XXX: [Integration]: Integration and testing
- [ ] #XXX: [Documentation]: Documentation updates
- [ ] #XXX: [Deployment]: Production deployment

### Progress Tracking
**Epic Progress**: 0/X child issues completed
**Current Phase**: Planning | Development | Testing | Integration | Deployment
**Blockers**: List any current blockers
**Risks**: Track emerging risks during development

### Communication
**Stand-up Schedule**: Daily/Weekly check-ins if needed
**Review Gates**: Milestone review points
**Stakeholders**: Who needs to be kept informed
```

##### 2. Child Issues Creation
Break down the epic into specific, actionable child issues:

```markdown
# Child Issue Template

## [Component]: [Specific Task]

**Parent Epic**: #[EPIC_NUMBER] - [Epic Name]
**Type**: Bug Fix | Feature | Refactor | Documentation | Testing
**Priority**: Critical | High | Medium | Low
**Estimated Effort**: X hours/days

### Task Description
**Objective**: What specifically needs to be accomplished
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Testing requirements
- [ ] Documentation requirements

### Technical Details
**Files to Modify**: List specific files or modules
**Dependencies**: Other child issues that must be completed first
**Testing Strategy**: How this will be tested
**Rollback Plan**: How to undo changes if needed

### Implementation Notes
**Approach**: Technical approach or algorithm
**Edge Cases**: Special cases to handle
**Performance Considerations**: Impact on performance
**Security Considerations**: Security implications
```

##### 3. Epic Branch Strategy
Create a long-lived epic branch that serves as the integration point:

```bash
# Epic branch creation and management
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b epic/build-system-v2.0

# Feature branches branch off from epic branch
git checkout epic/build-system-v2.0
git checkout -b feature/error-handling-system
# Work on specific feature
git commit -m "feat: implement comprehensive error handling"
git push origin feature/error-handling-system

# Create PR: feature/error-handling-system → epic/build-system-v2.0
# After review and merge, continue with next feature branch
```

##### 4. Development and Integration Cycle
Follow this systematic development pattern:

```bash
# For each child issue:

# 1. Create feature branch from epic branch
git checkout epic/[epic-name]
git pull origin epic/[epic-name]
git checkout -b feature/[specific-task]

# 2. Implement the specific change
# Focus only on this child issue's requirements
# Include tests and documentation

# 3. Create PR to epic branch
# Title: "feat: [specific task] (#child-issue-number)"
# Reference parent epic in description

# 4. Code review and merge to epic branch
# Update child issue as completed
# Update epic issue progress

# 5. Epic branch integration testing
# Ensure all components work together
# Run comprehensive test suite

# 6. Final PR: epic branch → main
# After all child issues completed
# Comprehensive review by maintainers
# Full CI/CD validation before merge
```

#### Example: Hugo Templates Build System v2.0

Here's how we apply this workflow to our current hugo-templates stability issue:

**Epic Issue**: `hugo-templates/#1 - Build System v2.0`
- **Epic Branch**: `epic/build-system-v2.0`
- **Child Issues**:
  - `#2`: Error handling system with comprehensive logging
  - `#3`: Test coverage framework for build scripts
  - `#4`: GitHub Actions optimization and debugging
  - `#5`: Documentation and troubleshooting guides
  - `#6`: Performance optimization and caching

**Benefits of This Approach**:
- **Traceability**: Complete history from problem to solution
- **Manageable Scope**: Each child issue is 1-2 days of focused work
- **Parallel Development**: Multiple developers can work on different child issues
- **Quality Control**: Epic branch allows integration testing before main merge
- **Progress Visibility**: Clear progress tracking for stakeholders
- **Risk Mitigation**: Epic branch isolation prevents main branch instability
