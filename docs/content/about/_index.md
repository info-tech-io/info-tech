# About InfoTech.io

InfoTech.io is an open-source educational technology organization dedicated to making high-quality IT education accessible to everyone, regardless of location or resources.

## Our Mission

We believe that quality IT education should be accessible to everyone, regardless of where they live or what resources they have. Technology is changing the world, and we want as many people as possible not just to observe these changes, but to become their driving force.

**Our mission is to remove barriers and make the path to IT understandable, engaging, and open to all.**

## Our Philosophy

### Open Source First
All our projects are 100% open source. We believe in transparency, collaboration, and the power of community-driven development.

### Education for Everyone
Quality education shouldn't be a privilege. We provide comprehensive, interactive learning experiences that are completely free and accessible.

### Modern Technology Stack
We use cutting-edge technologies to create fast, secure, and scalable educational platforms that provide excellent user experience.

### Community-Driven
Our projects grow and evolve with input from learners, educators, and developers worldwide.

## Our Values

- **Accessibility**: Education should be available to everyone
- **Quality**: We never compromise on the quality of our content or technology
- **Transparency**: Everything we do is open and documented
- **Innovation**: We constantly seek better ways to teach and learn
