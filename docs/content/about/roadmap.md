# InfoTech.io Development Roadmap

Our roadmap reflects our journey from initial concept to a comprehensive, self-sustaining educational platform.

## âœ… Stage 1: MVP (Minimum Viable Product) - COMPLETED

**Timeline:** July-September 2025
**Goal:** Quickly and cost-effectively validate our core concept: is there market demand for our approach to open and interactive education?

### Achieved Results
- âœ… **Domain and Platform:** https://infotecha.ru - INFOTEKA educational platform
- âœ… **Hub and Spoke Architecture** implemented and stable
- âœ… **3 Linux Modules** created and deployed to production
- âœ… **Quiz Engine v1.0.0** with full interactive testing system
- âœ… **Hugo + Apache2 + Wildcard SSL** - fast and secure infrastructure
- âœ… **Full CI/CD Automation** via GitHub Actions (commit to production in 2-3 minutes)
- âœ… **GitHub Organization info-tech-io** with 10+ repositories
- âœ… **100% Open Source** - all platform code and content is open

**Outcome:** Fully functional educational platform with interactive content, ready for public use and scaling. **Hypothesis confirmed - we've created a working ecosystem for IT education.**

## âœ… Stage 2: Architectural Transformation - COMPLETED

**Timeline:** September 2025
**Goal:** Transition to a more flexible, scalable, and decentralized architecture.
